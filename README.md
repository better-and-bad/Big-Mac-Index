# Big Mac Index Analysis

This repository contains the data and R scripts used for the analysis in the article on the Big Mac Index. The Big Mac Index, created and distributed by **The Economist**, is a tool for understanding currency valuation through purchasing power parity (PPP). This repository also includes supplemental data from the **Penn World Table** to provide a broader context for income comparisons across countries.

## **Data Sources**
### **1. Big Mac Index**
The Big Mac Index data is sourced from **The Economist**, which originally developed it as a lighthearted way to understand PPP and currency valuation. You can explore their latest updates and methodology on their [github repo](https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data).

### **2. Penn World Table**
The Penn World Table dataset provides detailed income and economic indicators for cross-border comparisons. [This data](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en) supplements the Big Mac Index by offering stable, multi-year PPP-adjusted income data.
